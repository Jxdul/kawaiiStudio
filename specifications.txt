# Photobooth App — Product Requirements & Technical Specification (v0.1)

**Owner:** Jadyl
**Last updated:** January 8, 2026
**Status:** Draft (build-ready spec)

---

## 1) Purpose

Build a **kiosk-style photobooth application** that guides a customer from **Start → Size → Quantity → Layout/Frame → Payment → Capture → Select Photos → Print + QR → Thank You → Home**, with a **secret staff menu** for configuration, diagnostics, reprints, and logs.

The app must be **themeable** and **frame-driven by folders**, so new frames and UI assets can be added without changing code.

---

## 2) Goals

### 2.1 Customer goals

* Simple “tap-to-start” experience.
* Clear options for **2×6** and **4×6**.
* Easy photo selection from **8 captured shots**.
* Printed photo includes **QR** to retrieve **digital image + recorded video**.
* Fast printing + friendly completion screen.

### 2.2 Staff goals

* Configure timers, pricing, and hardware settings.
* Track cash acceptor events and totals.
* Reprint last job with preview.
* Access robust logging for troubleshooting.
* Add new frames by dropping files into folders.

---

## 3) Scope

### In scope

* Kiosk UI flow (customer + staff).
* Frame scanning from folders (categories + templates).
* Cash payment via **serial bill acceptor**.
* Card payment: **placeholder architecture** (implementation TBD).
* Canon camera integration via **Canon SDK/API**.
* Continuous video recording during session capture.
* Composite image generation + QR overlay.
* Print pipeline to **DNP RX1HS**.
* Upload/hosting pipeline for image/video + QR destination (implementation details may vary, but interfaces must exist).
* Logging + audit trail.

### Out of scope (for v0.1)

* Online admin portal.
* Multi-language support (can be added later).
* Complex frame slot geometry per-frame (slots are fixed per template type).

---

## 4) Definitions

* **Session:** One customer run from “Tap to Start” until returning Home.
* **Template type:** Determines slot count & placement (fixed layouts).
* **Frame:** Transparent overlay PNG placed above composed photos.
* **Slots:** Rectangles where chosen photos appear within a template.
* **Even quantity rule:** Prints must be purchased in **2, 4, 6, 8…**

---

## 5) Hardware & Integrations

### Required

* **Camera:** Canon (via Canon SDK/API)
* **Printer:** DNP RX1HS
* **Cash acceptor:** Serial bill acceptor (events: inserted/accepted/rejected/jammed)

### Optional / future

* **Card payment** device/API (unknown; must be swappable)
* **Network upload** target (local server, NAS, cloud bucket, etc.)

---

## 6) User Experience: State Machine (Primary Flow)

**HOME → SIZE → QUANTITY → (LAYOUT if 4×6) → CATEGORY → FRAME → PAYMENT → CAPTURE → REVIEW/SELECT → FINALIZE → PRINTING → THANK YOU → HOME**

At any point:

* Inactivity timer triggers **Auto-return to HOME** (unless payment already confirmed; see §12).
* Critical errors show a friendly “Call Staff” screen + log event.

---

## 7) Customer Screens (Screen-by-Screen Requirements)

### 7.1 Home / Attract

**UI**

* Fullscreen background (theme asset)
* Large “Tap to Start” button
* Optional idle slideshow/video

**Logic**

* Touch/click starts a new session.
* Inactivity: remains in attract mode.

---

### 7.2 Size Selection

Buttons:

* **2×6**
* **4×6**

Rules:

* Must store selection in session.
* Back button returns to Home.

---

### 7.3 Quantity Selection (Even Only)

UI:

* Quantity stepper or button set: **2 / 4 / 6 / 8** (configurable max)
* Live price display

Rules:

* Only even numbers allowed (hard validation).
* Pricing depends on size (+ style if 4×6; see §8).

---

### 7.4 4×6 Layout Selection (Only if size = 4×6)

Options:

* **Style A:** 2 images (2 slots)
* **Style B:** 4 images (4 slots)
* **Style C:** 6 images (6 slots)

Rules:

* Store selected style in session.
* Next goes to Category/Frame flow.

---

### 7.5 Frame Category Selection

UI:

* Category tiles (from folders)
  Examples: “Kawaii Alley”, “K-Pop”, “Cute”, “Seasonal”, etc.

Rules:

* Categories are discovered automatically from folder structure (see §10).
* Selecting category opens frame grid.

---

### 7.6 Frame Selection

UI:

* Grid of frames (thumbnails)
* Preview panel showing frame overlay on template base
* Confirm button

Rules:

* Frames are loaded from disk; new frames appear automatically.
* Frame selection determines:

  * overlay image (PNG)
  * template type (implied by directory)
* Confirm → Payment screen

---

### 7.7 Payment

UI:

* Payment method options:

  * **Cash**
  * **Card** (disabled or “Coming soon” unless enabled in config)
* Price summary (size, style, quantity)
* “Cancel” (before payment confirmation only)

Rules:

* Cash: accumulate accepted value until total >= price.
* Must log bill acceptor events (insert/reject/jam/accepted).
* On success: mark session as **Paid** and proceed to Capture.
* After Paid: disallow returning to earlier screens (unless staff override).

---

### 7.8 Capture (8 shots)

UI:

* Live view area (if available)
* Countdown timer
* Shot progress indicator (e.g., 1/8 … 8/8)

Rules:

* Capture exactly **8 still photos** each session.
* Timing (configurable in staff menu):

  * pre-countdown length
  * interval between shots
* **Video recording**:

  * starts at beginning of capture
  * ends after last shot (or after review starts; configurable)
* Must handle camera disconnect:

  * show “Call Staff”
  * log error
  * do not proceed

---

### 7.9 Review & Select Photos

Layout:

* **Right side:** 8 thumbnails (captured)
* **Left side:** frame preview with slot positions

Interaction rules:

* Customer taps thumbnails to fill slots:

  * Selected thumbnail becomes **faded** and shows **slot number** (1..N)
  * Preview updates immediately with the chosen photo inserted into slot
* Customer can:

  * tap a selected thumbnail again to unselect it (clears that slot)
  * fill until required slot count met:

    * 2×6 requires **4**
    * 4×6 requires **2 / 4 / 6** depending on style
* Next button enabled only when all required slots are filled.
* Optional “Change Frame” button (configurable)

  * If enabled: returns to frame selection but keeps photos.

---

### 7.10 Finalize

Actions:

* Create final composite image:

  * place selected photos into template slots
  * apply frame overlay PNG
  * render print-ready at correct resolution
* Generate QR code (top-right placement; see §9)

  * QR links to a landing page containing:

    * digital image download
    * video download/playback
    * optional review link
* Save outputs to session folder and enqueue print.

---

### 7.11 Printing + Thank You

UI:

* “Printing…” status
* Show QR for review link (optional)
* Thank-you message

Rules:

* Print in background queue; UI must not freeze.
* On print success/failure:

  * log result
  * if failure: show “Call Staff” + allow staff to reprint.

Auto-return:

* After completion delay (configurable), return to Home.

---

## 8) Pricing Rules

### Base requirement

* Quantity must be **even** for both 2×6 and 4×6.
* Pricing is configured in staff menu and persisted to config.

### Recommended pricing model

* Price per “pair” (2 prints) for each product:

  * 2×6 (4-slot template)
  * 4×6 Style A (2-slot)
  * 4×6 Style B (4-slot)
  * 4×6 Style C (6-slot)

Example:

* totalPrice = pairs * pricePerPair
* where pairs = quantity / 2

---

## 9) Template Types & Slot Geometry

Slots are **fixed per template type** (not per frame). Frames must match the template’s pixel dimensions.

Template types:

* `2x6_4slots`
* `4x6_2slots`
* `4x6_4slots`
* `4x6_6slots`

Each template defines:

* Canvas size in pixels (print-ready)
* Slot rectangles: `x, y, width, height`
* QR placement rectangle (top-right) and size
* Optional padding/bleed settings

---

## 10) Frame & Asset File System (Auto-discovery)

## 15) Configuration Files (Recommended)

### `config/app.json` (example)

```json
{
  "kiosk": { "inactivitySeconds": 45, "lockAfterPayment": true },
  "capture": { "shotCount": 8, "countdownSeconds": 3, "secondsBetweenShots": 4 },
  "paths": { "frames": "./frames", "themes": "./themes/default", "sessions": "./sessions" },

    "printer": { "enabled": true },
    "camera": { "enabled": true }
  },
  "upload": { "enabled": true, "baseUrl": "https://your-landing-page-host/..." }
}
```

### `config/pricing.json` (example)

```json

```

(Real pixel sizes should match your printer/media pipeline; values above are placeholders.)

---

## 16) Architecture Requirements (Interfaces)

To keep card payments and devices swappable, implement providers:

* `ICameraProvider`

  * `Connect()`, `StartLiveView()`, `CapturePhoto()`, `StartVideo()`, `StopVideo()`
* `IPaymentProvider`

  * `StartPayment(amount)`, `Cancel()`, events: `OnProgress`, `OnSuccess`, `OnFailure`
* `IPrinterProvider`

  * `Print(file, quantity)`, `GetStatus()`, events: `OnJobUpdate`
* `IUploadProvider`

  * `UploadImage()`, `UploadVideo()`, returns `qrUrl/token`

---

## 18) Questions answers

1. **Platform:** Windows kiosk? (recommended if using DNP + Canon SDK) # will be windows
2. **Upload target:** local server vs cloud (affects QR landing page) # maybe will try to be on cloudflare
3. **Card payment provider:** Square/Stripe terminal/Moneris/etc. (API constraints) # will try stripe
4. **Exact print resolution/DPI & template pixel sizes** for each product # 1200 × 1800 for the full print. 2x6 will have to be duplicated side by side then sent to printer after with the option of cutting in half.
